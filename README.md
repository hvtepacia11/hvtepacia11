Hello there! 👋


I'm Henmyr, a Computer Science student at Negros Oriental State University.

I love turning ideas into code and bringing imagination to life through technology.

Outside of coding, I spend my time watching anime, playing games, and drawing. I also love exploring new places and experiencing things I haven’t before

Fun Facts:
⦁	I'm allergic to shrimp

⦁	One Piece is my favorite anime
